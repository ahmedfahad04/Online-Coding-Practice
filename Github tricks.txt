@Creating SSH Key:

STEP 1:
>> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_mail_address"
then the will ask for a file name, let it be empty
then they will ask for a passpharse(i.e. password), enter it
then enter the password again
>>eval $(ssh-agent -s)
>>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

...completed creating ssh key.

STEP 2:

@Uploading file/folder from my pc (local repository) to github( git repository):

STEP 1:
Open a repository in GitHub and dont click on Readme.

STEP 2:
open Git Bash on that folder from which you want to add files/folder.
>> git add .
>> git commit -m "your_message"
for the first time when your git repository is empty type this one,
>> git remote add origin [copy link form your git repository]
but this command can easily be found on your git new repository where heading is (... or create a new repository..). You will just need copy the last 2 commands form that section of your newly created repository in Github.

if you have added any folder/file in your repository then just type this one:
>>git push -u origin master
